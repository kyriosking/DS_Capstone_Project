## Project Motivation
This data contains key insights in maintaining user happy service. Our task in this project is to develop a model that predict which users have potential to cancel premium services, etc...
My work will give business more chances to provide suitable service to their customers.

I have prepared several insighs research to clarify throughout the project. You can find out at step `Feature Engineering` 
1. What is the total number of thumbs down by users for each churn?
2. And the opposite, How many thumbs up of the users?
3. Find out the number of errors that users encountered
